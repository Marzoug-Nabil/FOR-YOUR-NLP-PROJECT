## Introduction

In the field of Natural Language Processing, various techniques and tools play a crucial role in understanding, analyzing, and processing textual data. This repository serves as a guide to explain and demonstrate the implementation of popular NLP techniques.

## Techniques Covered

### Word Embeddings

Word embeddings are distributed representations of words in a continuous vector space. They aim to capture the semantic meaning of words based on their context.

### Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

TF-IDF is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents. It reflects how important a word is to a document in a corpus.

### Bag of Words (BOW)

BOW is a simplistic representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document without considering the order. It creates a sparse matrix of word counts.

### Word2vec

Word2vec is a neural network-based model that learns word embeddings by capturing the context of words in a document or corpus.

### Spacy

Spacy is an open-source library used for advanced NLP tasks. It provides pre-built tokenization, parsing, entity recognition, and linguistic annotations.

### Token Similarity

Token similarity involves measuring the similarity between tokens or words, often using various metrics such as cosine similarity or Jaccard similarity.

## Usage

Each technique in this repository includes detailed explanations, code samples, and demonstrations for implementation. Feel free to explore the respective directories for in-depth information on each technique.
